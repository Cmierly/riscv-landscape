# RISC-V Landscape | Pre-submission checklist:

> NOTE: Please ensure you've completed each of these items after submitting your pull request:

* [ ] Have you included a repo_url? Please select the most suitable GitHub repository for your project, rather than a GitHub organization.
* [ ] Is your project open source?
* [ ] Is the project currently and actively maintained (e.g., accepts pull requests, responds to issues)?
* [ ] Have you chosen the most appropriate (existing) category for your project?
* [ ] Does your submission adhere to the other guidelines from the new entries section?
* [ ] Have you added your logo's SVG to the hosted_logos directory and referenced it in the landscape.yml entry?
* [ ] Does your logo clearly display the project/product name and follow the other logo guidelines?
* [ ] Does the project name correspond with the text on the logo?
* [ ] Have you verified the accuracy of the Crunchbase data for your organization, including headquarters and LinkedIn?
* [ ] Approximately 5 minutes after opening the pull request, the RISC-V_Bot will post the URL for your staging server. Have you reviewed the site, confirmed it appears as expected, and then added a comment to the PR stating "LGTM"?
